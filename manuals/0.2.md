# RCLF 0.1 manual
## 1. Format
### 1.1. &rcl tag

$rcl tag means start of the RCLF document

Anything before &rcl will be ignored by `parser`, but not by `sntchk`

![A screenshot.](https://locomia.rf.gd/sources/0000.png "SNTCHK gave error")

To avoid this, you need to write `-n` before `-f`. `-n` disables the SNTCHK. But be careful! If you have broken syntax, you can damage everything and your environment will be broken.

### 1.2. Columns

In RCLF there are columns. Columns have their own keys and values. Columns have its own index, and it can't be duplicated (parser will give you fatal error).

Columns can repeat the same keys and values as other columns.

#### 1.2.1. &c[*n*] tag

&c[*n*] tag is the start of a column. In *n* you need to put an index for column. Column can't duplicate their index. This will give you `[rclf] return NULL: duplicate column index detected
` 
#### 1.2.2. &e tag

&e tag is end of the column. If you don't have &e tag, `sntchk` will give you `[rclf] return 6: missing &e tag in broken.rclf`, and with `-n`, parser will give you nothing.

### 1.3. Key & value system.

Now our document looks like this:
```hs
&rcl
&c[1]
&e
&c[3]
&e
```
But we need to add some information. To do this you need to understand Key & value system.

We have keys, they are separated by `;`. Keys can be mentioned only once by column. Example:

```hs
"Name";"Age"
```

(in 0.1 version you can't have only ONE key. this will be fixed in the future)

But every key needs a value. Values are separated by `:`. and can't be before keys. `sntchk` will give you `rclf] return 9: invalid value count for key 0 in broken.rclf: expected 0, got 2
`, but parser itself will ignore everything before keys.

Let's add some values to our keys...

```hs
"Name";"Age"
"Manager":"15"
"Meexray":"11"
```

Now, let's add this to the columns.

```hs
&rcl
&c[2]
"Name";"Age"
"Manager":"15"
"Meexray":"11"
&e
```

Wow! Now we have a RCLF document.

RCLF reader will give us this:

```hs
[rclf] reading "git.rclf"...
Col2 0/     "Name"
Col2 0 0~   "Manager"
Col2 0 1~   "Meexray"
Col2 1/     "Age"
Col2 1 0~   "15"
Col2 1 1~   "11"
```

Wow! Good environment!

### 1.4. Value types

1. Booleans

```hs
&rcl
&c[55]
"Name";"Age";"Is a dog?"
"Manager":"15":true
"Android":"2":false
&e
```
*Example of code with booleans using*

Booleans can be only true or false

2. String

String is `"anything in quotes"`.

## 2. RCLF reader

When we run RCLF, there are all the information:

```
usage:
  rclf out [-n] -f <file name> [-c N] [-k N] [-v N]

  rclf version

options:
  -f <file name>  Path to RCLF document
  -n              Disable syntax checking
  -c <N>          Column index (optional)
  -k <N>          Key index (requires -c)
  -v <N>          Value index (requires -c & -k)
```

to read you need to use `rclf out -f <filename>`

optional options is:

`-n` - disables `sntchk`. it's very dangerous, be careful when using this \
`-c [n]` - show only column by index N \
`-k [n]` - shows only key by index N (requires `-c`) \
`-v [n]` - shows only value by index N (requires `-k` and `-c`)

## 3. Returns

To learn everything about returns (error codes), I recommend you to read this block of code (from `errors.h`)

```c
// return (error) codes (very important)
// 1 2 4 returns from MAIN
// 3 returns from PARSER
// 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 returns from SNTCHK
enum RclfErrorCode {
    RCLF_ERR_INVALID_ARGS = 1,		     // (main) when there is invalid tag | example: rclf out -s
    RCLF_ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND = 2,	     // (main) when file from filepath isn't file
    RCLF_ERR_PARSING_FAILED = 3,	     // (pars) parser sends to main that something is not ok
    RCLF_ERR_EMPTY_FILE = 4,		       // (sntc) when file is empty
    RCLF_ERR_NO_RCL_TAG = 5,		       // (sntc) no $rcl tag in beginning
    RCLF_ERR_NO_END_TAG = 6,		       // (sntc) no &e tag in end
    RCLF_ERR_INVALID_COLUMN = 7,	     // (sntc) invalid &c using
    RCLF_ERR_INVALID_KEY_COUNT = 8,	   // (sntc) when keys is > or < than values
    RCLF_ERR_INVALID_VALUE_COUNT = 9,	 // (sntc) same as return 8 but with values
    RCLF_ERR_MEMORY_ALLOC = 10,		     // (sntc) error with memory
    RCLF_ERR_INVALID_SYNTAX = 11	     // (sntc) invalid syntax
};
```
